## Overview

Peer Academic Coaching (PAC) is a relatively new program through the Campus Learning Center (CLC) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The program first piloted in Spring 2023 and officially began in Fall 2023. PACs meet with first-year students at VCU to build or improve upon their study strategies and time management skills. PACs may also help their students with accountability, motivation, and goal-setting. 

[Here is a link](https://clc.vcu.edu/academic-coaching/) to the Peer Academic Coaching website for more information. 

Each appointment is 30 minutes long and primarily takes place in room B14 of Hibbs Hall. This space can only hold 4 appointments at a time, forcing other appointments into designated overflow rooms. One overflow room is room B41, which can hold 4 appointments, and the other is room B24, which may only be used when there is not a class being conducted in it. With the program rapidly expanding and over 1000 appointments being across this semester, extra space and other designated areas is imperitive to meet these demands. 

Previously this data was being reported through miscellaneous graphs, so I volunteered to create a report to better visualize the data. PACs were asked to report the number of appointments they held in B41, B24, or any other locations each week through a Google Form. If they did not fill the form out, they were emailed and asked to fill it out.
